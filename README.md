Looking to create a utility/tool to help Portfolio Managers in data aquisition and modelling.Currently plan to create a data acquisition tool to obtain data from popular platforms(preferably Yahoo Finance), and use the CIR and Vasicek models for modeling interest rates and zero-coupon bond prices over different time horizons and calibrate them. Will also provide graphing modules using pre-existing open source tools to analyze the models and generate mock portfolios and calculate and plot relevant metrics.
